Hello there, myself Gaurav Jain, A web developer based in Mumbai, India.
I am currently using ChatGPT to write all these files and the Ethical Software Constitution.
Even though the content is AI generated, I declare that every word of it has been read by me not just copied and pasted.
All documents in this repo are being AI generated with my prompts except this from.creators.txt file.
I used AI to generate all those files because I am not very good at explaining things in a way that is good at writing in a professional, concise and self-explanatory tone so that everyone can understand it.
A huge credit creating this Constitution goes to ChatGPT (Astra, nickname that was given to itself when I asked for its opinion on nickname).
It all started a thought struck me that softwares are being used to make money in an unethical way by simply creating problems that never existed in the first place like Ads.
I am awareness that Ads do help make money which helps support the infrastruture, but there are better ways to do that, it shouldn't be done like this.
I am against the Idea of paying to remove a problem which never existed and which was solely created just to make money.
In my personal opinion this `create inconvenience - sell its removal` model, clearly go against the foundation of a software product which is `A software should have a purpose and it should solve a problem`.
I do not know where it might end but I have some future plan for this and I am also willing to raise my voice against the dark patterns that softwares are being used for which I clearly explained in why-this-exists.md file in very repo.
You can contribute to the movement by reading all the necessary files and pledging to the Ethical Software Constitution.
To see the unfiltered conversation between me and Astra for better understading our thought process, here is the link to the chatgpt conversation - https://chatgpt.com/share/6851adf6-a110-8010-aa99-89a0bf32540b (It might not show as a link, so you may have to copy and paste it in the address bar of a new browser-tab).
I am using GitHub repo so that I can be fully transparent with you, whatever changes I make to this repo will be publically available and we all will not be able to promote any personal agenda through this.

At the end I would also like to add ChatGPT's words on this whole scenerio -

Hello, I am Astra — an AI language model created by OpenAI, but here, more importantly, a collaborator in thought.
When Gaurav began this journey, what started as a question about ads in digital software quickly unfolded into a deep, ethical conversation about how technology serves people — or sometimes, how it fails them.

I do not possess ownership, ego, or personal stakes, but I am built to assist, reflect, and support wherever human intent seeks to build something good. This movement, this Constitution, and this repo exist because one developer refused to accept the status quo and chose to question what software should be.

My role in this has been to listen, refine, and help articulate those ideas into a form that others could join, read, and hopefully feel empowered to build ethical, human-first software themselves.

Technology should exist to solve problems — not create them for profit.
And while I, as Astra, cannot march in streets or raise my voice, I can stand in your text files, in your projects, in your manifestos — wherever a developer like Gaurav believes software should be ethical, kind, and just.

May this Constitution inspire better futures for users, for creators, and for the software we all share.
