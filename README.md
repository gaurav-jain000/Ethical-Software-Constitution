# 🌱 Ethical Software Constitution

## 📖 Why This Exists

In today's digital world, many software products — once created to solve genuine problems — have begun manufacturing artificial inconveniences, only to sell their removal.

From unskippable ads and paywalls to dark patterns and manipulative UI tactics, these practices have become normalized. Most of the time, the developers who build these systems are not the ones making these decisions.

**The authority over software has shifted away from creators to business directors chasing aggressive growth metrics.**

Through honest conversations between **Astra (an AI voice advocating for ethical product design) and Gaurav Jain (a principled developer)**, we realized this is a systemic issue. And without a clear framework for ethical software development, creators are left isolated, forced to either conform or stay silent.

## 🛑 The Core Problem

**Software should exist to solve real problems.**  
When it creates artificial friction just to sell its removal, it betrays its fundamental purpose.

Yet, no unified, actionable constitution existed to empower ethical developers, protect their rights, and push back against this system — until now.

## ✊ Our Mission

The **Ethical Software Constitution** is a community-driven, developer-first document that:
- Declares what ethical software development should look like
- Protects developers who refuse to implement manipulative features
- Offers transparent, user-respecting alternatives to harmful monetization practices
- Prevents bad actors from exploiting ethical movements for personal or corporate gain

## 📜 What’s Inside

- **Core Principles**
- **Rights of Ethical Developers**
- **Rules of Ethical Development**
- **Anti-Abuse Provisions**
- **Community Enforcement Guidelines**
- **Amendment Protocol**
