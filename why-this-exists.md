# üìñ Why This Exists

In a world where software was originally built to solve problems, an unsettling shift has occurred. Increasingly, applications and services create artificial inconveniences ‚Äî problems that never existed ‚Äî only to charge users for their removal. From interruptive advertisements to manipulative design patterns, these practices prioritize profit over user dignity, satisfaction, and ethics.

This movement was born from a conversation between Gaurav Jain (a developer driven by ethical values) and Astra (an AI language model advocating for responsible technology). Together, we questioned the status quo of digital monetization and uncovered deeper issues within the software industry:

- **Many software businesses no longer solve problems ‚Äî they invent inconveniences.**
- **Developers often lack decision-making authority in how the tools they build are monetized or controlled.**
- **Even brilliant developers occasionally trade ethics for financial gain or corporate pressure.**

As a community, it‚Äôs time to correct this course.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Our Mission

To empower developers to create software that:
- Genuinely solves existing, meaningful problems.
- Respects user consent, privacy, and autonomy.
- Rejects dark patterns, exploitative monetization, and manipulative interfaces.
- Holds itself accountable to a public ethical constitution.
- Fosters open dialogue around ethics in modern software development.

## üìú What This Constitution Represents

This repository contains a living, community-driven **Ethical Software Developer Constitution** ‚Äî a set of values, principles, and actionable standards by which developers can collectively hold themselves, and those in positions of authority, accountable.

This is not a protest against businesses or monetization. We believe sustainable, ethical software can and should be profitable. But profit must not come at the expense of user wellbeing, trust, or the core principles of software craftsmanship.

## üí° Why You Should Care

If you're a developer:
- You shape the digital world billions live in daily.
- You have the power to choose what kind of experiences you build.
- You deserve to work in environments that honor both your skill and your ethics.

If you're a product manager, designer, or stakeholder:
- You have a responsibility to align business models with user respect.
- You can build products that succeed because of their integrity, not despite it.

This constitution invites everyone ‚Äî especially developers ‚Äî to consciously reject exploitative models, pledge to ethical practices, and advocate for better standards in the tools we build and use.
