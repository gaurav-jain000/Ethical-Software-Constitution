# 📜 Ethical Software Constitution

**Created by Gaurav Jain and Astra — a movement for developers, by developers.**

---

## 📖 Preamble

Software exists to solve problems, empower people, and enhance quality of life.
It must never be designed to exploit, deceive, or harm its users under the guise of profit.

In an era where dark patterns, manipulative monetization models, and invasive data practices have become normalized, we — developers, engineers, designers, and ethical technologists — pledge to uphold the dignity of our craft and the people we serve.

This constitution exists as a foundation for ethical software development, protecting those who wish to build with integrity, and guiding those seeking to change harmful systems from within.

## 🛡️ Articles of Ethical Software Development

- Ads, interruptions, or friction should never be artificially introduced to create paywalls.

### **Article II — Transparency**
- All monetization models must be openly communicated to users before engagement.
- Data collection practices should be minimal, necessary, and explicitly disclosed.

### **Article III — User Respect**
- Users are not products. Their time, privacy, and autonomy must be respected.
- Dark patterns, coercive UX, and deceptive design are violations of ethical software practice.

---

- No employer, business, or authority may coerce a developer into creating manipulative or harmful systems.
